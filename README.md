# PyConFR 2023: "Introduction to Sigstore: cryptographic signatures made easier" demo

This repository hosts the demo of the `sigstore-python` client from the talk "Introduction to Sigstore: cryptographic signatures made easier" presented at PyCon France 2023.
In this demo, we will sign a package with the `sigstore-python` GitHub Action, publish it to PyPI and then verify the signature on download using the client command line interface.
